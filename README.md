# Cookiecutter Data Science

_A logical, reasonably standardized but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._

**Cookiecutter Data Science (CCDS)** is a tool for setting up a data science project template that incorporates best practices. 

## Installation

Cookiecutter Data Science requires Python 3.8+. Since this is a cross-project utility application, we recommend installing it within the base conda environment. Installation command options:

```bash
# With pip from PyPI
pip install git+https://github.com/RowSquared/cookiecutter-data-science.git
```

## Starting a new project

To start a new project, run:

```bash
ccds
```

### The resulting directory structure

The directory structure of your new project will look something like this (depending on the settings that you choose):

```
├── LICENSE            <- Open-source license if one is chosen
├── Makefile           <- Makefile with convenience commands like `make data` or `make train`
├── README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.
├── data
│   ├── external       <- Data from third party sources.
│   ├── interim        <- Intermediate data that has been transformed.
│   ├── processed      <- The final, canonical data sets for modeling.
│   └── raw            <- The original, immutable data dump.
│
├── docs               <- A default mkdocs project; see mkdocs.org for details
│
├── models             <- Trained and serialized models, model predictions, or model summaries
│
├── notebooks          <- Jupyter notebooks. Naming convention is a number (for ordering),
│                         the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description, e.g.
│                         `1.0-jqp-initial-data-exploration`.
│
├── pipelines          <- The pipelines are composed of Jupyter Notebooks, R/Python scripts, and R Markdown files. 
│                         It is recommended to place these files into specific existing folders or 
│                         create new ones to ensure optimal navigation and organization.
│
├── pyproject.toml     <- Project configuration file with package metadata for {{ cookiecutter.module_name }}
│                         and configuration for tools like black
│
├── references         <- Data dictionaries, manuals, and all other explanatory materials.
│
├── reports            <- Generated analysis as HTML, PDF, LaTeX, etc.
│   └── figures        <- Generated graphics and figures to be used in reporting
│
├── requirements.txt   <- The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment, e.g.
│                         generated with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
│
├── setup.cfg          <- Configuration file for flake8, ploomber...
│
├── pipelines.yaml     <- Pipeline configuration file. It is reccomended to keep it at this level 
│                         as it might broke if moved into other folders. further info at https://docs.ploomber.io/en/stable/user-guide/index.html
│
└── {{ cookiecutter.module_name }}                <- Source code for use in this project.
    │
    ├── __init__.py    <- Makes {{ cookiecutter.module_name }} a Python module
    │
    ├── data           <- Scripts to download or generate data
    │   └── make_dataset.py
    │
    ├── features       <- Scripts to turn raw data into features for modeling
    │   └── build_features.py
    │
    ├── models         <- Scripts to train models and then use trained models to make
    │   │                 predictions
    │   ├── predict_model.py
